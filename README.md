# MeanscriptCS
Meanscript is a tool for data serialization featuring a human-readable script format and a compact bytecode format.

# Featuring

- Basic data types, like integers, floats, and text. Strong typing.
- Data structures.
- Generic types, like arrays and references.
- Memory management with both static and dynamic data objects.
- Scripting language to save data using variables, data structures, and functions.
- Bytecode format translated from a script or generated from source code.
- C# API to read, write, compile, and execute code.
- Simple GUI to execute scripts

# Design philosophy

- Practical. All-in-one solution for scripting and serializing.
- Minimal core and syntax: small and fast.
- Easy to expand. Integrate to your own source code with your own data types and callbacks.
- Easy to set up, stand-alone. Add Meanscript source code to your project and start scripting! Minimal dependencies to platforms and other software.
- Convenient. Easy to read and write, simple interface, easy to debug, and strong typing and type checking to avoid elusive bugs. Smooth crashing by exception handling, along with informative error messages.
- Iterative, non-blocking bytecode execution.
- <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-copy>Zero-copy</a>, when possible.

<!--swiss army knife, “opposite of domain-specific language (DSL)”, the one tool to all data serialization needs in a project.
no need to have multiple tools and languages in addition to source code.
known limitations: not going to oversome things like source code language’s own serialization. Not a tool for executable scripts… yet.
